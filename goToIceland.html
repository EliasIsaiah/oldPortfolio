<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>
This is the cover of a fictional tourist magazine for Iceland. The magazine covers topics such as reviewing popular stores within the capital city of Reykjavik, traversing and documenting hiking adventures through the Icelandic landscapes, Iceland's history, and the technology of Iceland.
</p>

<h2>Why Iceland?</h2>

<p class="table">
I travelled to Iceland during the summer of 2015. I had an amazing time, and took even more amazing pictures. It wasn't enough to simply look at these pictures and reminisce, I wanted to create something with them. I leapt at the opportunity when I was assigned this project in my graphic design class. 
</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<p>
The most challenging part of the <em>Go to Iceland</em> Project was cutting up and editing the pictures for the featured articles. By subtly erasing parts of the spray in the geyser pictures, I was able to keep the spray visible, but also give it elements of transparency so as to minimize the reduction of the background image's impact.
</p>

<h2>My favorite part</h2>

<p>
By layering my images and text elements, I was able to create a three-dimensional effect that greatly enhances the reader's enjoyment of the cover, while also providing information. By paying careful attention to the colors that were present in the pictures I used I created minimally stressful text for the reader.</p>
<p>I used a large, sans-serif font that is friendly on the eyes,and rather than the traditional black text on a white background, I went with white text on a black background, using the swathes of black to separate between different featured articles.
