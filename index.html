<h2>Welcome to Elias Roussos's ePortfolio</h2>
    <p>I've made this website to be a showcase of all of my skills and abilities, as well as my creativity. </p>
    <p>The first artifact of my ePortfolio is this website itself. Made with HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, this website is fully responsive and was designed mobile-first to provide the best experience, no matter what device you're using.</p>
