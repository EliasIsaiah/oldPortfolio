    <p>Photography started out as a hobby. I found that I enjoyed taking pictures, so I took pictures. I didn't think much of it, and I didn't think that I wanted to be a professional photographer. After making the decision to invest in a real camera, I approached photography from a different angle. I decided that, while I didn't plan on becoming a professional photorapher, I did want to use my photorgraphy in my work. I began incorporating my pictures in my websites, and using them on class projects.</p>

    <img src="images/photography/small/pic11small.jpg" alt="Icelandic Landscape 2" class="halfWidthBlock">
    </div>
    
    <p>Instead of relying on stock images, I put my own images to use. This is much more convenient, because I can make my own images any resolution that I want, and I don'thave to worry about paying someone for the rights to use their images.</p>
    
    
    <p>Photography isn’t a game for the faint of heart. I still haven’t fully explored the different settings on my camera, and I’ve learned to take my time and read the manual, and not be afraid to try something different. One of my favorite pictures was the result of taking a picture of something that was reflected in the glass of a camera lens that was sitting on my desk. I then took that image’s RAW file (the unprocessed file that a digital camera outputs) and edited it in Adobe Lightroom until I found the effect that I wanted. Lightroom has become an essential tool to me due to its exposure editing features – I don’t shoot with flash, and because of that sometimes my images look underexposed. Lightroom allows me to take that underexposed RAW and crank the exposure up to something that is presentable, without a loss in quality or an overabundance of noise (the multicolored spots that show up when a digital camera’s sensor overheats).</p>

    <p>Patience and experimentation are the lessons learned on the path to photography. The best way is to start simple and work your way up to the pros. I’ve still got a lot to learn about photography, such as color theory and how it relates to landscape imagery, and that’s my favorite part about it. There’s always something new to try.</p>
    
    <!--
    
    <p>I became interested in photography when I received my first smartphone. It was a Nokia Lumia 928, and if you don’t know much about the Lumia 9xx family of phones, suffice it so say that Nokia equipped them with decent cameras. With this new and better tool to take pictures with I discovered a fascination with photography. It’s not so much taking pictures that interested me, so much as trying to recreate what I saw with my eyes with a camera. As my interest grew I began experimenting with aspects of the camera like ISO, shutter speed, white balance and aperture. I decided to invest in an Olympus OM-D E-M5</p>
    <p>The OM-D is a beautiful piece of camera styled after Olympus’ old film cameras. It has a magnesium case with a grippy leather like material at the parts where your hands touch. This camera was part of a burgeoning class of camera that featured large sensors and interchangeable lenses that achieve imaging capabilities well beyond the conventional point-and shoot camera, nearing even the image quality of the DSLRs that professionals use. All of this fits into a compact body that is easy to carry about.</p>
    <p>With my OM-D I discovered a whole new dimension to photography. I bought something called a focal adapter that collects light and changes the properties of a lens on a camera, making the picture it captures wider and brighter. I bought multiple vintage lenses to use with my new camera with a adapters, thereby learning the full effect that things like changing the aperture has on total light collected by the sensor and the depth of field of the lens your shooting with (hint: the narrower your aperture, the less light is collected and the wider your depth of field is). I began taking more pictures, and enjoying every part of the process: the sounds the camera makes, the sensations of moving the different interlocking parts of the lenses, and the satisfaction of capturing just the right moment. </p>
    <p>Armed with a rapidly growing library of pictures, I decided to put them to use in other parts of my life (besides my rotating desktop wallpapers!). When I was building web sites, rather than using stock images as place holders or background I would use pictures that I took personally. When given projects in school I used my pictures there as well. I created a magazine cover about Iceland that is currently featured on my portfolio that exclusively uses my own images of Iceland from a vacation I spent there. I’ve received compliments and questions about my pictures, which feels good. By providing my own images, I feel like I’ve moved yet another important part of my “manufacturing” process in-house, saving on liability, labor and time. I don’t have to worry about licensing stock images, or trying to find a higher resolution source file.</p>-->
